//A sentence S is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

//We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)

//The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

//If a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append "ma" to the end of the word.
//For example, the word 'apple' becomes 'applema'.
 
//If a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add "ma".
//For example, the word "goat" becomes "oatgma".
 
//Add one letter 'a' to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.
//For example, the first word gets "a" added to the end, the second word gets "aa" added to the end and so on.
//Return the final sentence representing the conversion from S to Goat Latin.
